# main parameters
- player's health
- how close enemies are to the player when they die
	- if an enemy collides with a player, this should increase intensity substantially
	- consideration: what is the interplay between dodging enemies and shooting enemies? If an enemy is dodged, how does this affect game intensity?
- player's ammunition (assuming that they have some form of weapon)

# other parameters
- randomness or some kind of cycle
- proportion of health packs placed that player is collecting (which may somewhat measure platforming difficulty)
- proportion of enemies killed vs. dodged vs. collided with player
-
